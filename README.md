## PURPOSE

My intention with this website was to highlight elements of my personality and push myself to create something I'd never done before. Being completely new to development, I don't yet have a portfolio and haven't ever made a website. 
My hope with this project was to play, learn and see what I could do. I wanted to create a base that I could build upon in the future once I've learnt other languages. 
This design got me excited for what I could do next and quite honestly what I could do with more time and mentorship. If I've succeeded, this portfolio will showcase the immense amount of effort I put into anything I attempt, the skills I already possess and a healthy dose of me and my aesthetic.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

Anyone who will look! Opportunity can come from anywhere and I'm incredibly proud of what I've been able to achieve and learn in such a small amount of time. Ideally I hope this website showcases my current skills, my potential and my work ethic to potential employers within the development sector.  

## SITEMAP

## PAGES & FEATURES

#### Home/ Index:
- Polaroid Navigation 
- Title of my name using css styling
- Social Icon Links 


#### About:

- Secondary & Tertiary Page Header
- Social Icon Links 
- Basic Article 
- Photo of myself for user reference as people tend to like knowing who it is they're reading about.This image is also responsive and adjusts depending on screen size.  

#### Work:

- Secondary & Tertiary Page Header
- Social Icon Links 
- Resume download link included - this has been styled in the same way as all links and buttons for continuity to help build resinforce the function of the website the more the user progresses through it. 
- Portfolio Images - These currently hold a stylised X(image) as I don't have a development portfolio at the present but wanted to include this element for future development. 

#### Blog:

- Polaroid Navigation 
- The polaroid navigation was altered slightly to allow more of the center to show and this created a need for the page to scroll. 
- Social Icon Links 

#### Connect:
- Secondary & Tertiary Page Header
- Social Icon Links 
- Contact Form
- I originally had chosen to keep my connect page simple with my contact details and attempt to draw focus to the social icons however as they're relatively present across the site the page ended up feeling a little over worked, uninspiring and kind of clutered with the additional secondary headings. 

#### Blog Posts (1-5): 
- Secondary & Tertiary Page Header
- Social Icon Links
- Basic Article 
- Grouped Images

## PRIMARY COMPONENTS

#### Polaroid Navigation 

- Navigation using HTML/CSS built Polaroids, as a way to reflect a little bit about myself in a hopefully interesting way. These incorporated box shadowing for depth on the page and within the polaroid itself. 
- The stack orientation changes at 700px from a vertical stack to horizontal; this breakpoint was chosen as the polaroids also stop shrinking in size at that point. 
- On desktop there is a hover function that changes the color of the polaroid text to try reinforce it's a link. 
- This is also utilised in the blog page. At the 700px breakpoint the polaroids also adjust to a horizontal stack and the rotation of them changes for optimized viewing. As there are more then 4 polaroids the stack adjusts to 2 rows which could be repeated with more posts in the future. 
- There would be some further adjustments required to the existing positioning for increase polaroids but this should be easy enough as each polaroid has it's own class(class chosen over id incase replication of the individual polaroid needed in the future).

#### Secondary & Tertiary Page Header (including Hamburger Navigation) 

- Once beyond the Index page I chose to migrate the navigation to a Hamburger menu with Polaroid image to reference the index page as I wanted to make sure the focus shifted to the content. I chose to leave this as a Hamburger menu on all screen sizes for simplicity and to keep the reference. I fixed this to the screen for easy access as on some views the page does require scrolling for full content. 
- The Hamburger menu has a slight transparency to keep reference to the current page whilst still allowing the navigation links to hold visual priority. These links are identical to the index navigation for continuity (including change of color on hover).
- The polaroid icon has a hover rotation and when clicked has a slight transform for user experience. 
- As part of the header I chose to use an abreviated version of my name on the index page as a way to navigate back to the index page. 
- I tried to reference the visual elements of the index in a hopefully evident way that doesn't require a lot of thinking but also doesn't have to explictly say 'home' or 'menu'.
- I tried to adjust the header color depending on where you are within the Site Map.
- The use of checkbox does impact my Accessibility score as I haven't labeled the input field. 

#### Social Icons - Links

- Social Icon Links fixed to bottom of screen to be easily accessed and create continuity throughout the remainder website - these are all functional with attached links.
- I tried to adjust the background colors of the icons to match the header for continuity and chose to forgo the background colour accros the entire bottom as it felt unnecessary and restrictive.

#### Basic Article 

- This includes, heading, image and section for paragraphs the basic formatting is used across the blog pages and about page for continuity but could easily be reutilised in the future. 

#### Grouped Images

- There are 2 variations of group images, they were created in the same way but hold different formatting based on the current application. 
- I chose to leave both as the blog variation evolved from the portfolio and I'm not sure how I want the portfolio section to be utilised when I have relevant content. I may add further site pages that could be clicked through in the same way I've created the blog or I may chose to have the image increase in size when clicked to reveal the full content and then revert using a similar method as the hamburger with the invisible checkbox. 
- The blog variation includes the name of the blog post in the same link/button formatting used accross the website. The images are slightly transparent to start off and when hovered over become fully opaque. For the meantime I chose to leave the transparency in place for all media screens but in the future I'd potentially make adjustments. 

#### Contact Form 

- I decided to include a contact form that hopefully links to netlify after beginning the build of my website. 
- I chose to keep the form clean and simple; utilising the existing color scheme and link formating for the send button. The form does impact my accessibility as I don't label the input fields as I opted for placeholder text. This is likely something that could be remediated when using JavaScript. 

## FUNCTIONALITY

There are area's of my website that are fully functional and there are others that have room for improvement, particularly in relation to accessibility. One of the major pain points that came up was in relation to my background and foreground colors. This is something I'll definitely consider moving forward and consider from the start of my design process as I agree that there are elements of my website that could see this improvement but at the same time this website is not for the masses so I'm okay with some things being sacrificied slightly in favour of the original design choices. 

Outside the accessibilty of my website a couple other issues stem from my images. I did compress their size and try resize them to the max pixels I would require but ultimately there is more that can be done and will hopefully be resolved when I learn more and can focus on optimization.
